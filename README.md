# Legend of Zelda: First Dungeon

This was a project the elabraha and I worked on together for our game design class at the **University of Michigan**. We started with a base of assets and a simple tileing system, and from there built all the mechanics to the game. Not one asset is ours, but most / all the mechanics we either made from scratch or imitated from the original game.

(It's a little buggy, but it was our first project in Unity!)

There are two parts:

1. The original 1st dungeon from the original legend of zelda, reimplemented.
2. Our own personal dungeon, with unique mechanics, but reusing all the assets from the first dungeon.

## How to Open / Play

### Windows

1. Download the release 7z and unzip it with all it's contents into the same folder.
2. Run the .exe and select your resoultion.
3. Your good to go! If you complete the first dungeon you will then be able to play our custom dungeon.

### Mac

1. Download the release 7z and unzip the .app folder
2. Run the .app folder and select your resolution.
3. Your good to go! If you complete the first dungeon you will then be able to play our custom dungeon.

### Controls

* Press **A** to Attack.

* Use the **Arrow Keys** to move.

* Unfortunatly we nevever made a way to close the game, so you'll have to take advantage of your operating system to do that, sorry!

### Credits

Most of the credits to this go to the collecting of assets by the 370 staff.

Most or all of the assets come from assets already acumulated by the staff or openly found online. We don't claim rights to any asset used in our recreation of the this little piece of Zelda.
